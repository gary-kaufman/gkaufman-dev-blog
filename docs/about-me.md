# About Me

Hi I'm Gary!  

![pfp](images/gk-2023-circle-crop.png)  

I am an application developer based in Louisiana working in the various areas of development including front-end frameworks including React and Vue, as well as Kafka data pipelines and data visualizations with Python and Bokeh.  

I love coding and hiking with my wife and our son!
